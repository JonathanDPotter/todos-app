# Todos

This is my final project for TrueCoders. It is a simple todo app that connects to a back end REST API with full CRUD functionality for both user profiles and todo items. The back end repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/todos-api).

To run this app locally, you will need to provide a .env file with the address of the api. If you aren't running a local copy of the api you can use the hosted version which is: https://jp-todos-api-22f1a0f56308.herokuapp.com

## Technologies used

This app is built using React, TypeScript, Redux, React-Router, Tailwindcss, and AutoAnimate.

## Functionality

Upon first visiting the website a user is instructed to log in to view/create todo items. The user can register a new profile with a username and password or log in to an existing profile. Once logged in, a user can create, read, update and delete todos, update their username or delete their profile entirely.

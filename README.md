# Todos

This is my final project for TrueCoders. It is a simple todo app that connects to a back end REST API with full CRUD functionality for both user profiles and todo items. The back end repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/todos-api).

## Technologies used

This app is built using React, TypeScript, Redux, React-Router, Tailwindcss, and AutoAnimate.

## Functionality

Upon first visiting the website a user is instructed to log in to view/create todo items. The user can register a new profile with a username and password or log in to an existing profile. Once logged in, a user can create, read, update and delete todos, update their username or delete their profile entirely.
